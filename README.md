TransTEC model is developed by the Energy and Carbon Decision Making research team led by Professor Zhenhong Lin in South China University of Technology GuangDong China. 
The objective of this model is to leverage current medium- and heavy-duty vehicle (MHDV) data and information to evaluate the state of commercial vehicle decarbonization technologies, including the assessment of potential performance , cost drivers and markt share.
PCO file is used to set input parameters, give relationships between variables, and calculate the total cost of ownership.
Calibration powertrain is used to correct the coefficient of calculating the permeability between powertrain systems in the discrete choice model to make the historical data agree.
Calibration category is used to correct the coefficient of calculating the permeability between catergory systems in the discrete choice model to make the historical data agree.
